# 101239441_comp3123_assignment2_reactjs

This is my approuch to assignment 2 for COMP 3123 (Full Stack Development).
We are going to use ReactJS as our front end and MongoDB for our backend. Make sure you have docker to run this 
specific project. Make sure you install all the dependencies needed.

Run the code below to run the docker-compose.yml file

docker-compose -p assignment2-comp3123 -f docker-compose.yml up -d

API endpoints will be using port 8585 and the web application (front end) will use port 80. Make sure these 
ports are open and ready to be used.
